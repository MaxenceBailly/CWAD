# The CWAD project

## Description

The CWAD project is a multi-page project for a fictitious leisure space. 

We had to comply with a set of specifications, such as adding a video, a map to locate the leisure centre, a logo and so on. There was no need to make it coherent.

The project is based on a space cruise in which we will be able to travel through several planets and their cultures.


The pages are:

- Home: Arrival page presenting the leisure centre and the company.

- Cruise: Presents the activities

- Ticketing: Allows you to see the different packages and fill in a registration form.

- Contact: Provides information about the organisation and allows you to fill in a form to contact us.


The site is also responsive for mobile phones
